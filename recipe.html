        <p> <strong>Bufflo Crack Chicken Dip Recipe</strong> </p>
        
        <p> This is one of my favorite recipes because, I have alway's loved spicy food, especially bufflo. I came across this recipe one day when i was scrolling through facebook (thats what my entire facebook feed is) and as soon as I saw it I knew I knew i wanted to make it. This recipe goes best with <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Truco-On-The-Border-Tortilla-Chips-20-oz/29190829">Truco On The Border Tortilla Chips</a> that you can buy at walmart. It also goes great with celery. </p>
